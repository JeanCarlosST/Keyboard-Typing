# Keyboard-Typing

This project is created using React with a simple desing to test your typing speed on the keyboard. It uses [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for state management and the texts presented on this project are fetched from the [Quotable API](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable). You can also change the style of the keyboard using the dropdown at the top right.
